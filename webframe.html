            <h3>Web Frameworks: All You Should Know about It</h3>
            <p>A web framework is a software tool that provides a way to build and run web applications. As a result, you don’t need to write code on your own and waste time looking for possible miscalculations and bugs.</p>

            <p>n the early days of web development, all applications were hand-coded, and only the developer of a certain app could change or deploy it. Web frameworks introduced a simple way out of this trap. Since 1995, all the hassle connected with changing an application’s structure has been put in order because of the appearance of a general performance. And that’s when web-specific languages appeared. Their variety is now working well for both static and dynamic web pages. You can choose one website framework that covers all your needs or merge several, depending on your task.</p>
        </section>


        <section>Types of Web Frameworks</section>
<p>There are two main functions of frameworks for websites: to work on the server side <em>(backend)</em>, or on the <em>client-side(frontend)</em> , corresponding to their type. This division is not complicated and looks like this:</p>

<p>Frontend frameworks (client-side web frameworks) deal mostly with the external part of a web application. Briefly, it’s what a user sees when they open the app. The inside stuff is the work of the backend.</p>

<p><strong>Server-side frameworks</strong>. The rules and architecture of these frameworks allows you to create simple pages, landings and forms of different types. However, in order to build a web application with a well-developed interface, you should have a wider functionality. These frameworks can also form the output data and improve security in case of web attacks. All of these can definitely simplify the development process. Server-side frameworks work mostly on particular but important details without which an application can’t work properly. Here are top backend frameworks and the languages they work in:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Django – Python</li>
    <li>Zend – PHP*</li>
    <li>Express.js – Javascript</li>
    <li>Ruby on Rails – Ruby</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Client-side frameworks</strong>. Unlike the server side, client-side frameworks have nothing to do with business logic. Their work takes place inside the browser. Thus, one can improve and implement new user interfaces. Numerous animated features can be created with frontend frameworks as well as SPA (single-page applications). Each of the client-side frameworks differs in function and use. For comparison purposes, here they are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Backbone+Marionette</li>
    <li>Angular</li>
    <li>Ember.js</li>
    <li>Vue.js</li>
</ul>


<p>All of the frameworks mentioned above use Javascript as their coding language.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-functional frameworks</strong>. Meteor is known as a full-stack web framework. It means that it covers almost all the needs of both the client and server sides, which makes Meteor extremely popular and widely used. You don’t have to waste your time merging two frameworks using REST API; you can simply choose this one and accelerate your development process.</p>

    <h3>Web Frameworks: Features and Architecture</h3>

    <p>Despite the fact that frameworks are all different and it can be extremely hard to choose one, they all have something in common. I’m talking about their architecture and features, which are as important as functions.</p>

    <h4>Architecture</h4>

    <p>The architecture of almost all most popular web development frameworks is based on the decomposition of several separate layers (applications, modules, etc), which means that you can extend functionality according to your requirements and integrate your changes with framework code, or use third-party applications designed by external vendors. This flexibility is another key benefit of frameworks. There are a lot of open-source communities and commercial organizations that produce applications or extensions for popular frameworks e.g., Django REST Framework, ng-bootstrap, etc.).</p>

    <p>The MVC – that is, a Model, View and Controller – are the three things each web framework is made of. It is considered to be a basic structure, but there can be several contrasts among them.</p>

    <img src="https://cdn-bpaab.nitrocdn.com/ovmYDbOhMgMfItYufwmmRlRlkhckslfH/assets/images/optimized/rev-8763df0/djangostars.com/blog/content/images/2018/05/Img-2@2x.png" alt="Picture of MVC" width="400" height="400">

    <p>The model contains all the data and business logic layers, its rules and functions.</p>

    <p>The view, on the other hand, is responsible for all visual representations of data, like diagrams, charts etc.</p>

    <p>As for the controller, it simply converts the input data into the scope of commands of the previous ones.</p>

    <p>They are inseparable, and it’s extremely important to put the process in order to avoid troubles or mistakes while running an application.</p>


    <h4>Features</h4>

    <p>Now let’s take a look at some common features that help developers apply popular web frameworks as multifunctional and hands-on tool.</p>

    <img src="https://cdn-bpaab.nitrocdn.com/ovmYDbOhMgMfItYufwmmRlRlkhckslfH/assets/images/optimized/rev-8763df0/djangostars.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_3-1.png" alt="Image of features" width="400" height="400">

    <h4>Web Caching</h4>
    <p>Web caching simply helps store different documents and avoids annoying phenomenon of the server overload. Users can use it in various systems if several conditions are met. It also works on the server side. For example, you may notice cached content links on the SERP (Search Engine Results Page) of a search engine like Google.</p>

    <h4>Scaffolding</h4>

    <p>This is another important technique to know and use, which is supported by some MVC frameworks. Typical parts of application or the entire project structure (in case of initialization) can be generated by the framework automatically. This approach increases the speed of the development cycle and standardizes the codebase.</p>

    <h4>Web template system</h4>
    <p>A web template system is a set of different methodologies and software implemented to construct and deploy web pages. Template engines are used to process web templates. They are a tool for web publishing in a framework.</p>

    <h4>Security</h4>
    <p>Online security has plenty of criteria for identifying and permitting or rejecting access to different functions in a web framework. It also helps recognize the profiles that use the application to avoid clickjacking. As a result, the framework itself is authentic and authorized.</p>

    <h4>URL Mapping</h4>
    <p>If you want to simplify the indexing of your website by search engines while creating a clear and eye-catching site name, this web frameworks’ feature is custom-made for it. URL Mapping can also facilitate access to your sites’ URLs.</p>

    <h4>Applications</h4>
    <p>Numerous types of web applications are supported by web frameworks. The most common and best frameworks for app development support the construction of blogs, forums, general-purpose websites, content management systems, etc.</p>

    <p>All of these features are common to all frameworks. However, a paradox now appears: a developer has such a wide variety of tools and functions that he/she can simply get lost. That’s why you need to think carefully and create criteria that will make your work comfortable and easier. For example, your choice may depend on the language you prefer to use while coding. As previously mentioned, there are frameworks written in all languages. The second thing is the scope of tools that each framework has. If it covers all your working processes and helps you manage all your tasks, you’re on the right track. Speaking of preferences, this point may be the helpful or damaging. Of course, it’s better to use frameworks that are easy to learn, but sometimes old-school rules and a rarely used but suitable framework may lead you to success.</p>
