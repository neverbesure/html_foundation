                <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
                <p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets.” CSS is used to style the content of a web page by adding
                    design elements like colors, fonts, and spacing. You can use CSS to change the look and feel of any
                    element on a web page, from the overall layout to individual HTML tags.</p>

                <p>You can use CSS to make your web pages more attractive and easier to read. You can also use CSS to
                    improve the usability of your web pages and make them more user-friendly. You can also use CSS to
                    create different looks and versions of a web page for different devices, such as mobile phones and
                    tablets.</p>

                <h3>What does CSS stand for?</h3>

                <p>CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets. In web development, a style sheet refers to a document
                    that includes guidelines and directives governing the presentation of elements within a web page.
                    CSS adjusts the font, size, or decorative flourishes like animations or images. </p>

                <p>Every web browser comes equipped with a default style sheet. However, most web pages feature custom
                    CSS styles configured by web designers, which override the default CSS settings. The cascading
                    nature of CSS ensures that the last defined style sheet takes precedence. </p>

                <h3>The origin of CSS</h3>
                <p>The concept of styling a website emerged as early as 1994. While no single individual invented CSS,
                    Håkon Wium Lie, a Norwegian web pioneer and computer scientist, proposed the original idea.</p>

                <p>Soon afterward, Bert Bos, a renowned Dutch computer scientist known for his contributions to the Argo
                    browser, partnered with Lie to develop the CSS specification. Lie and Bos authored the first
                    official CSS specification, published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996. </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>How does CSS work? </h3>

                <p>If hypertext markup language (HTML) is the skeleton of a book, outlining the chapters, sections, and
                    content, then CSS serves as the book’s cover design and typography, enticing readers to pick up and
                    explore the book.</p>

                <p>More technically, HTML elements represent different components on a web page, such as a paragraph or
                    a heading. For example, this is an HTML tag:</p>

                <strong>
                    <p>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</p>
                </strong>

                <p>Remember, the paragraph on its own lacks styling. The following CSS code, however, can style this
                    paragraph: </p>

                <strong>
                    <p>p { color: purple; font-weight: bold; }</p>
                </strong>

                <p>In the CSS mentioned above, “p” acts as the selector, specifying that the styling applies to all HTML
                    paragraphs. The code within the curly brackets forms the declaration, which includes properties
                    (color and font) and their corresponding values (purple and bold) that the selector will inherit.
                </p>


                <p>Similarly, altering the values can achieve various styles. For example, a property like
                    “background-color” can have values like “red” or “blue, “background-position” can have values like
                    “top” or “bottom,” and “text-align” can have values like “center,” “right,” or “left.”</p>

                <h3>Types of CSS</h3>
                <p>A web designer may harness one of three CSS types to style and customize a website: inline, embedded
                    (internal), or external. Let’s explore each of them in detail below.</p>

                <h4>Inline CSS</h4>

                <p>Inline CSS applies styles to a single HTML element and defines them within its style attribute. This
                    approach is useful for rapidly previewing, testing, or addressing issues with web pages. However,
                    excessive inline CSS can cause the HTML structure to become disorderly.</p>


                <h4>Embedded CSS </h4>

                <p>Embedded or internal CSS involves placing the CSS code directly within the HTML file. This is useful
                    when applying a unique style to a specific HTML page. However, using embedded CSS for multiple pages
                    can be tedious, as the CSS style must be added individually to each page.</p>


                <h4>External CSS</h4>

                <p>External CSS is particularly useful for styling large websites. To apply external CSS, web pages must
                    connect to an external.css file. The approach enables web designers or developers to maintain a
                    consistent style across all pages. Then again, it’s important to note that using multiple CSS files
                    may impact website loading time. </p>

                <p>In summary, the use of inline CSS applies to individual elements, while embedded CSS pertains to
                    specific pages, and external CSS serves for styling an entire website. Choosing the right CSS type
                    depends on the project’s unique requirements and scope, considering the advantages and disadvantages
                    of each approach in website styling.</p>

                <h3>Pros and cons of using CSS</h3>

                <p>Every programming language has its strengths and weaknesses. Let’s look at some notable advantages
                    and disadvantages of using CSS in web development:</p>

                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Support for simultaneous application of styles across multiple web pages</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Streamlining site upkeep, CSS allows changes to website design elements without altering the
                            underlying HTML code.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Choosing the right CSS type can be confusing</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>CSS code fragmentation across web browsers may cause compatibility issues</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
